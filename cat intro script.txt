Cat:
		Malek! Watch out, Malek! You're in a duel!

		"Who's Malek"? Did you hit your head on that tree? Pick up your staff!
		
		Ready yourself, now! Do I need to show you how to fight?
		
		--- first scene (scripted first fight) ---
		
Cat:
		Nice one! You defeated the EVIL Kelam and retrieved his crystal balls.

		...Well... your staff did at least...
		
		Who am I? Must've been a hard tree. I'm your lucky cat familiar, of course!

		Now, defeat his golem and let's escape this forest.

		--- second scene (golem fight) ---

Cat:
		What a spooky castle this is... let's go in!

		What do you mean, you're not sure? Maybe use the D. O. R. E.?

		...

		The DOOR!

		Don't look at me like tha... WOAH, WATCH OUT! DRAGON!

		--- third scene (dragon fight) ---

Cat:
		...okay.. okay... you got me...

		:burps:

		There was never a dragon... :burps: ...or a cat.

		I was just trying to scam you.

		Moral of the story: Watch out for scammers pretending to be lucky familiars pretending to be dragons trying to scam you!

		Sometimes they really look like the real deal!
